Images
eg <!-- <img src="image.jpg" alt="brown dog" width="400" height="300"> -->
The interesting part is that every image must have these four characteristics. 

The source attribute (SRC), which instructs the browser which image file to load first, is what we have. 
The image's text description is then provided by the alt attribute (ALT). 

The width and height properties are the last ones that control the image's size. All four of these qualities should therefore be present in every image.
